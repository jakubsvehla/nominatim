## Usage

```ruby
places = Nominatim.search('San Francisco').limit(10).address_details(true)

for place in places
  puts "#{place.display_name} (#{place.type})"
end

puts "Found #{places.count} places."
```

### Structured requests

```ruby
places = Nominatim.search.city('San Antonio').country('Mexico').limit(10).address_details(true)

for place in places
  puts "#{place.display_name} (#{place.type})"
end

puts "Found #{places.count} places."
```

Nominatim::Search has the following methods to craft structures requests:

- street: accepts house number and street name as parameters
- city
- county
- state
- country
- postalcode

See http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim#Parameters

Nominatim::Search has the following flags to toggle result details:

- address_details - Include a breakdown of the address into elements
- extra_tags - Include additional information in the result if
               available, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.

## Configuration

```ruby
Nominatim.configure do |config|
  config.email = 'your-email-address@example.com'
  config.endpoint = 'http://open.mapquestapi.com/nominatim/v1'
end
```
